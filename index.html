        <h1>Why do I like ODESZA?</h1>
        <p>ODESZA was, no doubt, my gateway band to the Indie genre in general. My favourite style of music, since I
          was
          a kid, is Electronic Music. I would spend whole afternoons in Soundcloud trying to discover new music, new
          artists, like Kygo, The Chainsmokers, between others back then, when, in 2014 I discovered ODESZA.
          <br>
          With them, my perception of music changed, it was more organic, almost orchestral. And with them, more
          artists
          and genres came, at least for me. I could say it changed my life, musically speaking. Started paying more
          attention to the sounds, to the way and way some music is built that way.</p>
